 You will create 3 pages:

     Home page (accessible to everyone)
     Dashboard page (accessible by user and admin)
     Admin page (accessible by admins only)

2 guards:

     isConnected
     isAdmin

A user service:

     a private property 'role' which will take the value 'ANONYMOUS', 'USER' or 'ADMIN'
     a method to return the ‘role’.

You will have to think about the conditions to put in your guards to validate the rules of access to the pages.
